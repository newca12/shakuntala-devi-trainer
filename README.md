### About ###
[Shakuntala Devi][1]'s trainer is a brain training tool. 

shakuntala-devi-trainer is an EDLA project.

The purpose of [edla.org](http://www.edla.org) is to promote the state of the art in various domains.

### Usage ###
The goal is to determine [the day of the week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determination_of_the_day_of_the_week) for a given date.  
The technic used by Shakuntala Devi is describe in her book [Figuring the Joy of Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8122200389).  
You can see an overview in Tibee's video [India's Human Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LHzUkfQ8oE&t=534s) or in this livejournal [entry](https://fiat-knox.livejournal.com/1067226.html) 

To launch the GUI 
```
cargo run
``` 

To launch the text console version
```
cargo run -- --cli
```

If you use the console version your answer should be encoded as an integer like described in the book like so :
* Sunday 0
* Monday 1
* Tuesday 2
* Wednesday 3
* Thursday 4
* Friday 5
* Saturday 6

If your answer is wrong only the text console version will give you a hint for now.  
Each hint is the result of a step of Shakuntala Devi's algorithm

### Developer Notes ###
* [Modulo of negative numbers shows languages in two different camps.](https://torstencurdt.com/tech/posts/modulo-of-negative-numbers)  
* Rust conveniently allow infinite lazy stream with iterator
* num-traits is required for Weekday::from_u32
* lazy_static is required to provide a singleton HashMap
* [By default Rust test programs hide the stdout of successful tests](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25107081)
* [Rust built-in test framework does not support parameterized tests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34662713/how-can-i-create-parameterized-tests-in-rust)
